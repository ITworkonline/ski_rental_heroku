        <p> Buying ski equipment is expensive. Especially for students. So we're going to develop a ski rental website where users can quickly order ski equipment. For managers, they can manage the inventory of ski equipment by adding, modifying, and deleting certain skis. The inventory information will be fed back to the user's reservation interface in real time.</p>
